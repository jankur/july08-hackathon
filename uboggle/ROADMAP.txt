- on the first page load, the server generates a random board and sends
  the board layout (as a JSON encoded object) to the client
- the client JS renders the received board layout
- all the code for user clicks etc lives in the client JS
- we will (eventually) have a nice UI to show the user what pieces she
  has clicked, and the order in which they have been clicked
- once the user is done clicking, she clicks submit
- server validates the response, client updates UI accordingly
- client maintains a timer. on timer expiration, show final scores,
  other words users have suggested, final score etc
